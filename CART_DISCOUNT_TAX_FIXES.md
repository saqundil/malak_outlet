# Cart Discount & Tax Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Price Without Discount Fixed
**Problem**: Cart was showing original prices instead of discounted prices
**Solution**: Updated CartController to use `$product->final_price` instead of `$product->sale_price ?? $product->price`

**Before**: Used sale_price or regular price
**After**: Uses final_price attribute which properly calculates all active discounts

### 2. ✅ Tax Line Removed
**Problem**: Cart summary showed unnecessary "الضريبة: مشمولة" line
**Solution**: Removed the tax line from cart summary as taxes are already included in prices

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Discount Display
**New Features Added**:
- **Discount Badge**: Shows percentage discount when applied
- **Original Price**: Crossed out original price when discounted
- **Total Savings**: Shows total amount saved in cart summary
- **Celebration Message**: "🎉 وفرت X د.أ" when there are savings

## Technical Changes

### CartController.php
```php
// OLD
$price = $product->sale_price ?? $product->price;

// NEW  
$price = $product->final_price; // Uses discount calculations

// Added savings calculation
$totalSavings = $totalOriginal - $total;
```

### Cart View Enhancements

#### Mobile Layout:
- Shows discount percentage badge
- Displays original price crossed out
- Highlights discounted price

#### Desktop Layout:
- Shows "خصم X%" badge
- "السعر الأصلي" crossed out
- "سعر الوحدة بعد الخصم" label

#### Cart Summary:
```php
@if($totalSavings > 0)
- Original Price: XXX د.أ (crossed out)
- Total Discount: -XXX د.أ (green)
- Celebration: "🎉 وفرت XXX د.أ"
@endif
```
